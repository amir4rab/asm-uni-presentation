## A Simple and crude Benchmarking Benchmark of front-end libraries / Frameworks

This is a simple and crude benchmark, comparing some of the most favorite front-end libraries. the mentioned libraries are listed below:

 - [NextJS](/ssr/next-ssr/) ( representing ReactJS )
 - Angular
 - [Solid Start](/ssr/next-ssr/) 
 - Preact SSR

Keep in mind due to my lack of experience with Angular and Solid Start, they might be at a disadvantage compared to other contestants. You can find the code for each framework in the [`ssr`](/ssr/) directory. In case you are associated with any of the mentioned libraries / frameworks, it would be awesome to have your suggestions on how to improve their implementation.
